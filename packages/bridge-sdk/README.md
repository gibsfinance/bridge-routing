# Bridge Sdk

tooling to help facilitate briding over omnibridges and apply a price to delivery

these are low level tools so they will have to be put together carefully

they are also in beta stages of development so things may simply change version to version

to make things easier, versions are synced across packages

## install
```sh
npm i --save @gibs/bridge-sdk
```

## usage

```ts
// global import
import * as bridgeSDK from '@gibs/bridge-sdk'
// or by file
import * as abis from '@gibs/bridge-sdk/abis'
```
