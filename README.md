# Bridge Routing

A repo for running the [gibs.finance](https://gibs.finance) frontend

## Getting Started

```bash
# Install dependencies
bun install

# To run the development server, run:
bun dev

# or

# This will start the server and open the app in a new browser tab. You can also run the server without opening the app with:
bun dev -- --open
```

## Building

To create a production version of your app:

```bash
bun run build
```

You can preview the production build with `bun run preview`.

> To deploy your app, you may need to install an [adapter](https://kit.svelte.dev/docs/adapters) for your target environment.
